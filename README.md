## Development History

## Acknowledgments

ASK about how we are suppposed to schedule number of processes - just use what is available, or always make sure it is properly distributed

Talk about performance analysis - ask if we must go over things already covered in the last assignment -ex multithreading, having 1 more task then worker functions

talk about format for printing results -is there one, or just up to us
